### Hi 👋

I'm a MERN Stack Developer specializing in building scalable, full-stack web applications. I develop end-to-end solutions that are dynamic, responsive, and performance-focused, ensuring both a smooth user experience and robust backend functionality.

With expertise in React.js, Next.js, Redux, Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, I craft modern web applications that are cleanly coded, secure, and maintainable. I'm comfortable working independently or as part of a team, and I prioritise clear communication and structured development practices.

I’ve worked with startups, agencies, and businesses across various industries to deliver real-world solutions from custom CRMs and admin dashboards to data-driven portals and full-stack web platforms built entirely with the MERN stack.
